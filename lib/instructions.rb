    Welcome to Tic Tac Toe

    This is the classic game where you have to mark with an X or 0 your position on the board.

    To play, each player will have to select a position in the grid by choosing a number from 1 to 9.
    Each number corresponds to one of the positions in the grid. You can choose any position that is empty.
    You select your move by typing the number that corresponds to the position you wish to mark.

    The first player to make a line of three consecutive marks wins the game.
    The line can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
